# Picking-Numbers-algo
This code solves the Picking Numbers problem by finding the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is no more than 1. The code counts the frequency of each number, then finds the maximum sum of frequencies between consecutive numbers, since valid subarrays can only contain numbers that differ by at most 1.
